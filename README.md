# Project Mongo API

we should build an Api with mongoose that had atleats 3 endpoints.

## The problem

I tried to make a few endpoint for instance one that could sort the shows by year and show them in an order were the newest were displayed at the top but actually i could not get that to work even when i tried diffrent sulotions for it , i then read somewere that it easier to filter and sort in frondend so i draped that endpoint idea and insteda focused on getting the deploy to work.

## View it live

I got the deploy to work like 10 min before demosðŸ¥³ view it here https://sandras-project-mongo-api.onrender.com
